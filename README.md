# Supporting the project

This is the fourth version of the video game. I have tested it as best as I could but I'm absolutely aware that some fault may have due to its
complexity. The fact that the project is open source is the real way for the community to solve all the possible problems together, feel free 
to open an issue or do a pull request. See the open issues for a list of known issues (and proposed features).
